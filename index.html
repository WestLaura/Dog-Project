            <h3>Human's Best Friend Needs Us</h3>
            <p>
              The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Dogs were
              domesticated over 15,000 years ago. The dog has been selectively
              bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities,
              and physical attributes. They perform many roles for humans and
              due to their influence on human society, they have earned the
              title of "man's best friend."
            </p>
            <p>
              Whilst many dogs live happy lives, full of the love and care they
              deserve, some are not so lucky and they experience neglect and
              abuse at the hands of humans. I have put together this site to
              bring attention to this, and provide links to charities or other
              organisations that help protect and rescue dogs from often
              terrible situations. Please explore to find out how you can make a
              difference.
